DragonFire
==========

DragonFire is a horizontal scrolling shooter inspired by the likes of [R-Type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-Type).
It's developed in DragonRuby.

I actually intended to build a Roguelike first, but the prospect of exploring all this engine
could do regarding bullets and fast-paced action proved too tempting.


The source code to DragonFire is released under the MIT License. To build it, you will also
need a licensed copy of [DragonRuby](https:/dragonruby.org) - please support this awesome engine!
